## The Texture Pack Maker's Secret Weapon

Ever spent hours moving transparent PNGs around, flipping textures, or hunting for duplicates? Yeah, me too. *Way too many hours.* That's why I built this little sanity-saving toolkit.

**If you're a texture pack maker, THESE TOOLS ARE A MUST.** After wasting countless hours doing the same handful of painfully tedious tasks, and constantly thinking "there's got to be a better way," I kept adding new tools to make my life easier. At this point, I felt guilty keeping all this time-saving goodness to myself!

## What's Inside This Magic Box?

Nex Tex Tools is your Swiss Army knife for texture processing! It helps you:

- **Find and sort** those pesky transparent PNGs
- **Flip textures** because game devs love storing things upside-down (WHY?!)
- **Detect PS2 textures** with that weird variable alpha that drives us all mad
- **Fix transparency issues** with just a couple clicks
- **Fill transparent areas** so you can actually see what you're working with
- **Remove duplicates** because who needs 47 copies of the same texture?
- And more texture-wrangling magic!

## Who's This For?

If you've ever whispered curse words at 3AM while manually sorting through PS2 texture dumps, this is for you.

If you've tried to explain to non-modder friends why you're spending days making old games look prettier, this is for you.

If you know the pain of realizing you just spent an hour editing the wrong version of a texture, this is DEFINITELY for you.

## Join Our Texture Revolution!

Come find me on Discord, hit me up on Reddit, or (if you're feeling extra generous) buy me a coffee on Ko-Fi so I can stay caffeinated enough to keep building tools that save us all from the mind-numbing tedium of texture pack creation, as well as keep making thoes texture packs!

Remember: Life's too short to flip textures manually. Let's build amazing texture packs together! ✨
